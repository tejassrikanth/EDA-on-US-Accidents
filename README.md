US accidents Dataset has 47 columns and 2.8 million data. This dataset presents several contributing factors for accidents that happened in the United States between 2016 and 2021.
The submitted dataset is subjected to a quick exploratory data analysis.

Due to the dataset's excessive size, I won't be able to upload it here. I will provide a URL, though, so you may access the dataset online.
